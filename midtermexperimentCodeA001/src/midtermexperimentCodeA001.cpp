 * Project: Magician's Staff (ie kind of like Gandald's staff)

/*
 * This is a rought draft / psuedo code as comments for the midterm project.
 * The minimum goal is to control the hue lights and Wemo switches in the classroom. I am also required to use certain parts like the OLED display.
 * I will be using buttons to run different controls. The buttons will be attached along the length of a wooden dowel.
 * Larger parts will be housed in the end of the rod in an enclosure.
 * Upon first glance, the staff will look like a regular decoration, without any functionality.
